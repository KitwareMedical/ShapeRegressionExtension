# ShapeRegressionExtension

Description
-------------

Computation and visualization of time-regressed shapes in a collection of 3D shape inputs associated to a linear variable thanks to two modules: RegressionComputation and RegressionVisualization. 

ShapeRegressionExtension is now available as a 3D [Slicer](http://www.slicer.org) and as a [SlicerSALT](http://salt.slicer.org/) extension.

Prerequisites
-------------

* RegressionComputation module uses [Shape4D](https://github.com/jamesfishbaugh/shape4D) CLI to compute time-regressed shapes. 
* RegressionVisualization module uses [Sequences](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.8/Extensions/Sequences) module to visualize the time-regressed shapes over time.
